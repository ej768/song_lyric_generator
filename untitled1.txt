how can it be nice
i'm a little pad
he hurt you then but that's not me
why don't you let me hear your heart feel sad

sometimes i feel so bad
sha na na na na na sha na na sha na na
na na na na na na na sha na na
when i could sit around and let you go dum bay do da

where can i come on
i'm waiting for the captain ashore
where can i come on
you bring back your love to me is what i could try to be more

took a look at my wind chimes
he hurt you then but that's not true
i know now but i have to wait so long
that you belonged to me is what i could try to be a single thing we couldn't do

you didn't think that i could be married
well i feel very sad
i had to prove that i left at the wrong time
well i feel so bad

with me to a lullabye
i've been trying hard to be a single thing we couldn't do
you'd never change but that's all done
remember the day is new

i've been trying hard to find it by myself
that sun can get so hot that you still believe in me
did did did did doo dim duh did doo dim duh dum did doo dim duh did doo dim duh did doo
it's so hard i try hard to be

remember the day is new
you didn't think that i won't leave behind
the world could show nothing to me is what i could be better
for sure you're with me tonight i know you're with me tonight i know she must be kind
