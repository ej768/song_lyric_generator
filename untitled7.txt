she goes with me tonight i know there's an answer
i made you feel so bad
and makes me come alive
could fill your heart feel sad

you bring back your love to me is what i could sit back and let me go home let me go home
unafraid of what a blow
remember the day is new
that sun can get so hot that you still loved him so

ba barbara ann so i packed up and split for the captain ashore
no more no more no more no more no more no more
well i feel very sad
ba barbara ann so i packed up and split for the captain ashore

laughed so hard all day
i try hard to be a single thing we couldn't do
good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good vibrations oom bop bop
did did did doo dim duh did doo

on and on she go dum bay do da do do do do do da
yeah barbara ann ba ba ba ba ba barbara ann ba ba
now how can it be
on and on she go dum bay do da do do do do do da

she goes with me tonight i'm sure you're with me tonight i know that i could sit back and let me go home
i peeked in and when your face looked sad
if it weren't for the wheel's still in spin
it makes you feel glad

you didn't think that i could be better
that sun can get so hot that you still loved him so
i've been trying hard to be a single thing we couldn't do
she'll return in love years ago

took a look at my wind chimes
to ride in the eyes of the world could show nothing to me
in the night night
where can i come on the sloop john b
