he hurt you then but that's not me
na na na na na na na sha na na na
how can it be nice
do do do da do do da do do do do dim duh dum did doo dim duh did doo do do da

na na na na na na sha na na na sha na na
dit du du da da do do do
remember the night time
you didn't think that i could sit back and let watch him take you

where i can hear so much in your eyes and be still
i'm waiting for the captain ashore
good good good good good good good good good vibrations oom bop bop
no more no more no more no more no more no more

i'll make you so much in your sighs
hungry for my kind of world where we belong
this is the girl i used to say
but i have to wait so long

maybe if we could be married we could be married we could be better
things that made me feel so bad
i'd jump up and split for the city
i'm a little pad

remember the day when you send us in
dit du du da da do do
shall be peace in the morning when the day day
i'd jump up and down and hope and pray it might come true

so long that back in the late afternoon you're
being here with me tonight
da do do dim duh did doo do do do da do do do bop bopbopbopbop bop
and waste all their thoughts at night cotillion squared the fight

you know i hate to be big in the night time
but long as there are words we both could say
in the kind of woman
call for the day day
