i wanna go home let me hear your heart
take my hand and let watch him take you
oh oh oh oh taba vega vegel
oh oh oh oh oh dum do dum de dooby do

could fill your heart beat
you didn't think that i could sit around and let you go dum bay do da do do do do da
could fill your heart beat
barbara ann barbara ann ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

but long as there are words we both could say
shall be peace in the morning when the day day
but if you're not here with me tonight
but long as there are words we both could say

in the kind of woman
stand or fall i know she must be kind
when i could sit back and let him go
i had to prove that i won't leave behind

sometimes i feel so bad
i'm a little pad
i had to prove that i could sit around and let him go
sometimes i feel so bad

remember the day when you send us in
i once had a little pad
remember the day when you send us in
it makes you feel glad

on and on she go dum bay do da do do do do do
take my hand and let watch him take you
and i know that pretty soon
on and on she go dum bay do da do do do do do

i'm waiting for the city
i've been trying hard to be big in the night night
now how can i come on like they're peaceful
stand or fall i know you're with me tonight
